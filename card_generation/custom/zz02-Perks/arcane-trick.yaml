- body: "Choose one of the following effects:

    • You teleport a size 1S or smaller object adjacent to you into an unoccupied space adjacent to you.

    • Until the start of your next turn, a part of your body shoots a shower of harmless noisy sparks that light up each square adjacent to you.

    • You ignite or snuff out (your choice) every mundane light source of 1L or smaller adjacent to you.

    • You transform up to 1 pound of edible food you touch to make it taste delicious or disgusting.

    • Until the start of your next turn, you make your body exude a particular odor you’ve smelled before. This smell can be sensed by each creature within 5 squares of you, but can’t impose any condition or other drawback on those creatures.

    • You place a small magical inscription on the surface of a mundane object you touch, or you can remove an inscription that was made by you or by another creature using Arcane Trick.

    • You touch a size 1T object to cover it with an illusion that makes it look like a different object. Any creature who handles the object becomes aware of the illusion. The illusion ends when you stop touching the object."
