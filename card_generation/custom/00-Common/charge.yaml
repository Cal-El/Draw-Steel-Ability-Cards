- body: You move up to your speed in a straight line, then make a melee free strike (see Free Strikes) against a target when you end your move. If you have an ability with the Charge keyword, you can use that ability against the target instead of a free strike.


        You can't move through difficult terrain or shift when you charge. You can fly or burrow as part of the Charge main action if you have that movement available to you, but you can't climb or swim while charging unless you can automatically use that movement at full speed.
