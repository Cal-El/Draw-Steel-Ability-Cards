      You conjure a size 4 dragon that appears in an unoccupied space within
      distance. The dragon has speed 6 and can fly, stability 4, 100 Stamina,
      immunity all to fire damage, and uses your characteristics. The dragon
      disappears at the end of the encounter, if their Stamina drops to 0, or if
      you are dying.

      On subsequent turns, you can use a main action or maneuver to command the
      dragon.
