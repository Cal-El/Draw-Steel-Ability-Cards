# Card Generation Script

## Requirements
In order to run the script, you need to:
1. Install python 3
1. Install the required python libraries `pip install -r ./card_generation/requirements.txt`
1. Have a valid GitHub ssh token set up so that you are able to pull down the required rules json from Steel Compendium.

## Running the Script
Simply run `python ./card_generation/generateCards.py`. On mac, you may have to run it under specifically `python3` rather than just `python`.
