body:
- body: You jump up to your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. Until the
    end of your next turn, a static afterimage of you remains in the space you left,
    and any enemy adjacent to your afterimage takes a bane on ability rolls. You can
    use your abilities from your own space or from the space of your afterimage as
    if you were still there. Additionally, if your Null Field ability is active, your
    afterimage also projects the aura from that ability, which you control as if you
    were in the afterimage's space.
