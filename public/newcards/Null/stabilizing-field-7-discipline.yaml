- body: Until the end of the encounter, the size of your Null Field ability increases
    by 1. While the area of that ability is enlarged this way, you ignore difficult
    terrain and reduce the potency of enemy effects targeting you by 1 for you. You
    can also use a free triggered action at the start of each of your turns to end
    one effect on you that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end of your
    turn. Each ally in the area also gains these benefits.
