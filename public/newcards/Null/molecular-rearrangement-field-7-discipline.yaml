- body: Until the end of the encounter, the size of your Null Field ability increases
    by 1. While the area of that ability is enlarged this way, each enemy who has
    I < AVERAGE and enters the area for the first time in a combat round or starts
    their turn there is bleeding (save ends). Each ally who enters the area for the
    first time in a combat round or starts their turn there gains temporary Stamina
