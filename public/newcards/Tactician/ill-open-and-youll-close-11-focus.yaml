- body: One ally within 10 squares of you can use a heroic ability against the target
    as a free triggered action without spending any of their Heroic Resource, as long
    as they have enough Heroic Resource to pay for the ability. If the target is reduced
    to 0 Stamina before the chosen ally has used their ability, the ally can pick
    a different target.
