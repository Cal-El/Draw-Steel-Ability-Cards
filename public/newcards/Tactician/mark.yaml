    \ dying, or until you use this ability again. You can willingly end your mark\
    \ on a creature (no action required), and if another tactician marks a creature,\
    \ your mark on that creature ends. When a creature marked by you is reduced to\
    \ 0 Stamina, you can use a free triggered action to mark a new target within distance.\n\
    \nYou can initially mark only one creature using this ability, though other tactician\
    \ abilities allow you to mark additional creatures at the same time. The mastermind\
    \ tactical doctrine's Anticipation feature allows you to target additional creatures\
    \ with this ability starting at 5th level.\n\nWhile a creature marked by you is\
    \ within your line of effect, you and allies within your line of effect gain an\
    \ edge on power rolls made against that creature. Additionally, whenever you or\
    \ any ally uses an ability to deal rolled damage to a creature marked by you,\
    \ you can spend 1 focus to gain one of the following benefits as a free triggered\
    \ action:\n` `\u2022 The ability deals extra damage equal to twice your Reason\
    \ score.\n` `\u2022 The creature dealing the damage can spend a Recovery.\n` `\u2022\
    \ The creature dealing the damage can shift up to a number of squares equal to\
    \ your Reason score.\n` `\u2022 If you damage a creature marked by you with a\
    \ melee ability, the creature is taunted by you until the end of their next turn.\n\
    You can't gain more than one benefit from the same trigger."
