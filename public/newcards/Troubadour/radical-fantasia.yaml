body:
- body: While this performance is active, each target who starts their turn in the
    area ignores difficult terrain, and any ability they use that imposes forced movement
    gains a +2 bonus to the forced movement distance until the end of their turn.
    Additionally, once per combat round, each target can use a triggered action as
    a free triggered action.
