- body: Add your current Stamina to your target's current Stamina, then you have half
    that total Stamina and the target has the remainder. If either of you would gain
    more Stamina this way than their Stamina maximum, the difference in Stamina between
    what that creature would gain and their maximum is gained by the other creature.
    Neither of you can gain more Stamina than your maximum this way. You then make
    a power roll.
