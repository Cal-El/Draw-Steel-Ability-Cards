- body: 'A size 5 tree appears in an unoccupied space within distance. The tree has
    100 Stamina and can''t be force moved. You and any ally can touch the tree to
    use the Catch Breath maneuver as a free maneuver. Additionally, when you start
    your turn with line of effect to the tree, you can end one effect on yourself
    that is ended by a saving throw or that ends at the end of your turn, or you can
    stand up if you are prone. Each ally within distance also gains this benefit.

    Each enemy who ends their turn within 3 squares of the tree is restrained until
    the end of their next turn. A creature restrained this way can use a main action
    to end the effect early.'
