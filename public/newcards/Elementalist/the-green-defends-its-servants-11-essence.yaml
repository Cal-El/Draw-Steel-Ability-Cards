body:
- body: You conjure an elemental shield that protects the target until the end of
    your next turn. While the shield is active, the target can take the Defend main
    action as a maneuver on each of their turns. The target gains 30 temporary Stamina
    that lasts until depleted or until the effect ends. If this temporary Stamina
    disappears, the effect ends and the shield explodes, dealing 10 damage to each
    enemy within 5 squares of the target.
