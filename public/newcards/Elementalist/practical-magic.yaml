    - You use the Knockback maneuver (see Chapter 10: Combat), but its distance becomes
    the range of your Hurl Element ability, and you use Reason instead of Might for
    the power roll.

    - You choose a creature within the distance of your Hurl Element ability and one
    of the following damage types: acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison,
    or sonic. That creature takes damage of the chosen type equal to your Reason score.

    - You teleport up to a number of squares equal to your Reason score. If you choose
    this option, you can spend essence to teleport 1 additional square for each essence
    spent.'
