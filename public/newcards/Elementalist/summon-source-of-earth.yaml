body:
- body: 'A **source of earth** emerges from an unoccupied space within distance. The
    source takes their turn immediately after you, moving up to their speed and either
    taking a main action or a maneuver. The source is dismissed at the start of your
    next turn.

    The source starts an encounter at full Stamina, but maintains their current Stamina
    throughout the encounter, even if they are dismissed and you use this ability
    again. They can''t regain Stamina during the encounter. When the source''s Stamina
    is reduced to 0, you can''t use this ability again until you earn 1 or more Victories.'
