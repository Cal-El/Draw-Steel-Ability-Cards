body:
- body: 'You touch a square containing mundane dirt, stone, or metal and create a
    5 wall of the same material, which rises up out of the ground and must include
    the square you touched.

    Alternatively, you touch a structure made of mundane dirt, stone, or metal that
    occupies 2 or more squares. You can open a 1-square opening in the structure where
    you touched it. You can instead touch an existing doorway or other opening that
    is 1 square or smaller in a mundane dirt, stone, or metal surface. The opening
    is sealed by the same material that makes up the surface.'
