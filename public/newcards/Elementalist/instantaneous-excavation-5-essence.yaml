body:
- body: You open up two holes with 1-square openings that are 4 squares deep, which
    can be placed on any mundane surface within distance. You can place these holes
    next to each other to create fewer holes with wider openings. When the holes open,
    make a separate power roll for each creature on the ground above a hole and small
    enough to fall in. (You can't score a critical hit with this ability because it
    uses a maneuver.)
