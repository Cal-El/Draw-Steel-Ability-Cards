body:
- body: You can speak to the target if they are a creature who has died within the
    last 24 hours and who can speak a language you know, even if they are just a head.
    The target regards you as they would have in life, and you might need to make
    tests to influence them and convince them to speak with you. The trauma of dying
    can make a creature's memory of that event hazy, but the target otherwise knows
    all they knew in life. After 1 minute, the effect ends. You can't use this ability
    on the same creature twice.
