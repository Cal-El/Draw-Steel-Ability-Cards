body:
- body: You create two illusory duplicates of the target, which appear anywhere within
    distance. These duplicates last until the end of the encounter. On each of their
    turns, the target can move each duplicate up to their speed. If the target is
    targeted by an ability, they can use a free triggered action to switch places
    with a duplicate within their line of effect, making the duplicate the target
    of the ability instead. When either duplicate takes damage, it is destroyed.
