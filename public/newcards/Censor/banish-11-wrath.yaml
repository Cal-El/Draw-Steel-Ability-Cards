- body: This ability gains an edge against demons, devils, undead, and creatures not
    native to your current world. If you know the target's true name, this ability
    has a double edge. While banished, the target is sent to another manifold in the
    timescape and removed from the encounter map. A banished target can do nothing
    but make saving throws, and takes 10 holy damage each time they do so. If the
    target is reduced to 0 Stamina while banished, they are lost to the timescape.
