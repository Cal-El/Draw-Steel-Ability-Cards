body:
- body: You attach a small bomb to a creature. If you are hidden from the creature,
    they don't notice the bomb and you remain hidden. The creature otherwise notices
    the bomb and can disarm and remove it as a main action. If they don't, at the
    end of your next turn, the bomb detonates. When the bomb detonates, you make a
    power roll targeting each enemy within 2 squares of it.
