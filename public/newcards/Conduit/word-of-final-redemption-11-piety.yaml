- body: Before the target dies, you can look at their stat block and force them to
    use one ability that is a main action or a maneuver. If the ability costs a Heroic
    Resource or Malice, the creature can use it without any cost. For the purpose
    of using this ability, your allies and enemies are the target's allies and enemies,
    and you decide who the ability targets.
