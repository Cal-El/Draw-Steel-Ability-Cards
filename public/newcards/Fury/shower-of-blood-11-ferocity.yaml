- body: Each enemy within 5 squares of you is distracted until the end of the round.
    While a creature is distracted this way, they can't take triggered actions or
    free triggered actions, ability rolls made against them gain an edge, and their
    characteristic scores are considered 1 lower for the purpose of resisting potencies.
