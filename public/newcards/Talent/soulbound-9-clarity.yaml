- body: If any target becomes stitched to the other, both targets are stitched together.
    While stitched together, a target takes a bane on power rolls while not adjacent
    to a creature they're stitched to. Whenever a stitched target takes damage that
    wasn't dealt by or also taken by another stitched target, each other stitched
    target takes half the damage the initial target took.
