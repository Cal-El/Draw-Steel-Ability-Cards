      Until the end of the encounter, the area of your Null Field ability
      increases by 1.

      While the area is enlarged this way, you and any ally in the area ignore
      difficult terrain, reduce the potency of enemy effects targeting them by
      1, and can use a free triggered action at the start of each of their turns
      to end one condition or effect that is affecting them.
