      object up to a number of squares equal to your Reason, Intuition, or
      Presence score (your choice). You can use this ability to turn doorknobs,
      pull levers, and manipulate other smaller, movable pieces of a larger
      object as long as the piece you're manipulating is unattended and size 1T
      (though you canâ€™t use this ability to break smaller piece off of a larger
      object).
