      You summon a spirit of size 2 who can’t be harmed, and who appears in an
      unoccupied space within distance. 


      The spirit lasts until the end of your next turn. You and your allies can
      move through the spirit’s space, but enemies can’t. An enemy who moves
      within 2 squares of the spirit for the first time in a round or starts
      their turn there takes holy damage equal to your Intuition score.
