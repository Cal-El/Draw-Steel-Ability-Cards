      You step into a mundane dirt, metal, or stone object (including a wall)
      that is as large as you or larger. You can remain inside the object for as
      long as you like. 


      While inside the object, you can observe events and speak to creatures
      outside of it, but you donâ€™t have line of effect to anything outside the
      object and vice versa.

      You can travel through the object freely until you exit it. If the object
      you meld with is destroyed, you take 10 damage and exit the object.
