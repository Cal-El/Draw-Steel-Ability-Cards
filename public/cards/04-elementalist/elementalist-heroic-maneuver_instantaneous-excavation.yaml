      You open up two holes with 1-square openings that are 4 squares deep, and
      which can be placed on any mundane surface within distance. You can place
      these holes next to each other to create fewer holes with wider openings.

      When the holes open, make a separate power roll for each creature on the
      ground above a hole and small enough to fall in.
