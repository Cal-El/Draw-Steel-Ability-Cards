    value: >-
      The target is judged by you until the end of the encounter, you die, you
      use this ability again, or you willingly end this effect (no action
      required).  If another censor judges the target, then your judgment on the
      target ends.


      If a judged creature uses an action and you have line of effect to them,
      you can use a free triggered action to deal holy damage equal to twice
      your Presence score to them.


      When the judged creature is reduced to 0 Stamina, you can use a free
      triggered action to use this ability against a new target within distance.


      In addition, you can spend 1 judgment to take one of the following free
      triggered actions. You can’t use more than one instance of a benefit per
      trigger:

      ` `• **When an adjacent judged target shifts**, you can make a melee free
      strike against them. The target doesn't shift and their speed becomes 0
      until the end of this turn. 

      ` `• **When a judged target makes a power roll**, you can add a bane to
      the roll. 

      ` `• **When a judged target within distance uses an ability with a potency
      against another creature**, you reduce the potency of the ability by 1 for
      that creature (to a minimum of 0).
