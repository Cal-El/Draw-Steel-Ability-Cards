      You can see, hear, and smell as if you were in the creature’s space.

      Additionally, you can borrow their mouth to speak when you wish to do so.
      You speak in a different voice than theirs. This effect ends when you use
      Share Sense on a different target, when the creature moves more than 10
      away from you, or when the creature is no longer willing to share their
      head with you.
