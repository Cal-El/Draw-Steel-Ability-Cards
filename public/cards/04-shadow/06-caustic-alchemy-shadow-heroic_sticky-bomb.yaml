      You attach a small bomb to a creature. If you are hidden from the
      creature, they don’t notice the bomb and you remain hidden. The creature
      otherwise notices the bomb and can remove it as an action, disarming the
      bomb. 

      At the end of your next turn, the bomb detonates. You can also detonate it
      earlier (no action required). When the bomb detonates, you make a power
      roll targeting each enemy within 3 squares of it.
