    value: You turn invisible and create a magical illusion of your corpse falling
      in your space. While you are invisible, you gain a +3 bonus to speed and
      you ignore difficult terrain. The illusion melts into the ground and your
      invisibility ends at the end of your next turn, or earlier if the illusion
      is interacted with, if you take damage, or if you use an action or a
      maneuver.
