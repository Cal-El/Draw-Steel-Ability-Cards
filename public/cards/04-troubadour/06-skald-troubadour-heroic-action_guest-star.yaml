    value: Either a bystander within distance is uplifted by your magic, or a
      mysterious new hero appears in an unoccupied space to help out during the
      encounter. This guest star is controlled by you, has their own turn,
      shares your characteristics. Their stamina is maximum is half yours. They
      have no abilities other than your melee and ranged free strikes. When the
      target is reduced to 0 Stamina or at the end of the encounter, they
      retreat or revert to a bystander. An individual bystander can’t be
      uplifted in this way more than once in an encounter.
