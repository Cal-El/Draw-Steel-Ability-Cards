      Until the end of the encounter, both you and the target can target each
      other with abilities even if you are beyond distance, with the distance of
      this ability replacing those abilities’ distances. Abilities that grapple
      or force move a target are ignored if the target isn’t within the distance
      of the ability.  

      Additionally, on each of your turns, you can use a free maneuver to
      communicate a motivating or dispiriting message to the target, either
      giving them two surges or a bane on the next attack they use before the
      start of your next turn.
