    value: At the end of each of your turns while this routine is active, you can
      choose a number of creatures equal to your Presence score in the aura,
      causing those creatures to be teleported to unoccupied squares in the
      aura. A target canâ€™t be teleported in a way that would harm them (such as
      over a cliff), leave them dying, or result in them suffering a condition
      or other negative effect.
