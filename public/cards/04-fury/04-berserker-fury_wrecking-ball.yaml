      You move up to your speed in a straight line. During this movement, you
      can move through mundane structures, including walls, which are difficult
      terrain for you. You automatically destroy each square of structure you
      move through and leave behind a square of difficult terrain.


      Additionally, you make one power roll that targets each enemy you come
      adjacent to during the move.
