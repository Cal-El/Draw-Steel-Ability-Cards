      You can shapeshift into the animal defined by your stormwight kit, a
      hybrid form, or back into your true form. 

      While in animal form or hybrid form, you can speak normally and can speak
      to animals who share your form. If you are in a negotiation with an
      animal, you treat your Renown as 2 higher than usual while in animal form.

    value: As a free maneuver on your turn, you can shapeshift a second time, either
      into another animal form, into your hybrid form, or back into your true
      form.
