      You can speak to the target corpse (including just the head) of a creature
      who has died within the last 24 hours and who can speak a language you
      know. The target regards you as they would have in life, and you might
      need to make tests to influence them and convince them to speak with you.
      The trauma of dying can make a creature’s memory of that event hazy, but
      the target otherwise knows all they knew in life. 


      After 1 minute, the effect ends. You can’t use this ability on the same
      creature twice.
