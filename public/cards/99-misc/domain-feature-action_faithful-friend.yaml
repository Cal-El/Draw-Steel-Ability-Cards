      You conjure a spirit that takes the form of any animal you have seen. The
      incorporeal animal can’t physically interact with the world, but they have
      a speed of 5 and can fly. While you are within 10 squares of the spirit,
      you can sense everything an animal of their type would sense, in addition
      to sensing your own surroundings.


      You can dismiss the spirit at any time (no action required). If the spirit
      takes any damage, it is dismissed and you take 1d10 psychic damage, which
      can’t be reduced in any way.
