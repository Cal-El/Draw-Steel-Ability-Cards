      You move up to your speed in a straight line without shifting, and can
      then make a melee free strike (see Free Strikes) against a creature when
      you end your move. 


      You can’t move through difficult terrain as part of your movement with
      this action. You can’t climb, fly, or swim as part of this action unless
      you have that type of movement as a keyword in your speed.
