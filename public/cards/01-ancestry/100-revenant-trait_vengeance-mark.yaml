      You place a magic sigil on the target. 

      When you place a sigil, you can decide where it appears on the creatureâ€™s
      body, and whether the sigil is visible to only you or to all creatures.


      You always know the direction to the exact location of a creature who
      bears one of your sigils and is on the same world as you.


      You can have an active number of sigils equal to your level. You can
      remove a sigil from a creature harmlessly (no action required). If you are
      already using your maximum number of sigils and place a new one, your
      oldest sigil disappears with no other effect.
