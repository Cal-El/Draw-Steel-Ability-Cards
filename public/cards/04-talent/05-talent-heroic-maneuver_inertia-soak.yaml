      The target ignores difficult terrain and takes no damage from forced
      movement until the start of your next turn. 

      Whenever the target moves into a square while under this effect, they can
      push one adjacent creature up to 2 squares. If pushing an ally, the target
      can ignore that allyâ€™s stability.
  - key: Strained
    value: You are weakened and your stability decreases by 5 (save ends). If your

      moved.
