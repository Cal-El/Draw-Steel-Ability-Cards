      The aura lasts until the start of your next turn.

      Whenever an enemy targets an ally in the aura with a ranged ability, the
      ability is negated on the ally and reflected back at the enemy. The
      ability deals half the damage to the enemy that it would have dealt to the
      ally, and loses any additional effects.
  - key: Strained
    value: The size of the aura increases by 1. Each ability your aura reflects
      causes you to take 2d6 damage and makes you forget a memory, as determined
      in consultation with the Director.
